    Given the proposal boxes and the groundtruth boxes and classes, perform the
    groundtruth matching by taking the argmax of the IoU between boxes and
    groundtruth boxes.

    Args:
      boxes: a tensor of shape of [batch_size, N, 4] representing the box
        coordianates to be matched to groundtruth boxes.
      gt_boxes: a tensor of shape of [batch_size, MAX_INSTANCES, 4] representing
        the groundtruth box coordinates. It is padded with -1s to indicate the
        invalid boxes.
      gt_classes: [batch_size, MAX_INSTANCES] representing the groundtruth box
        classes. It is padded with -1s to indicate the invalid classes.

    Returns:
      matched_gt_boxes: a tensor of shape of [batch, N, 4], representing
        the matched groundtruth box coordinates for each input box. The box is
        considered to match to a groundtruth box only if the IoU overlap is
        greater than `foreground_iou_threshold`. If the box is a negative match,
        or does not overlap with any groundtruth boxes, the matched boxes will
        be set to all 0s.
      matched_gt_classes: a tensor of shape of [batch, N], representing
        the matched groundtruth classes for each input box. If the box is a
        negative match or does not overlap with any groundtruth boxes, the
        matched classes of it will be set to 0, which corresponds to the
        background class.
      matched_gt_indices: a tensor of shape of [batch, N], representing the
        indices of the matched groundtruth boxes in the original gt_boxes
        tensor. If the box is a negative match or does not overlap with any
        groundtruth boxes, the index of the matched groundtruth will be set to
        -1.
      positive_matches: a bool tensor of shape of [batch, N], representing
        whether each box is a positive matches or not. A positive match is the
        case where IoU of a box with any groundtruth box is greater than
        `foreground_iou_threshold`.
      negative_matches: a bool tensor of shape of [batch, N], representing
        whether each box is a negative matches or not. A negative match is the
        case where IoU of a box with any groundtruth box is greater than
        `background_iou_low_threshold` and less than
        `background_iou_low_threshold`.
      ignored_matches: a bool tensor of shape of [batch, N], representing
        whether each box is an ignored matches or not. An ignored matches is the
        match that is neither positive or negative.
