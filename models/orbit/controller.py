    Args:

        training details.
      evaluator: An instance of `orbit.AbstractEvaluator`, which represents
        model evaluation details.
      global_step: An integer `tf.Variable` indicating the global training step
        number. Usually this can be obtained from `iterations` property of the
        model's optimizer (e.g. `self.optimizer.iterations`), or users can
        create their own global step variable as well. If the users create their
        own global step variable, it is recommended to create the `tf.Variable`
        inside strategy scope, and with
        `aggregation=tf.VariableAggregation.ONLY_FIRST_REPLICA`.
      steps_per_loop: The number of steps to run in each "inner loop" of
        training (passed to the `num_steps` parameter of `trainer.train`).
      checkpoint_manager: An instance of `tf.train.CheckpointManager`.
      summary_interval: Step interval for training summaries. Note that this
        argument only applies to the summaries inside `trainer.train` function.
        Summaries outside like "steps_per_second" and outputs from
        `trainer.train` function will always be enabled. If set, the value
        should be divisible by steps_per_loop.
      summary_dir: The directory to restore and write checkpoints and summaries.
        For example, You can set it to `checkpoint_manager.directory`.
        If None, it will not write training summarizes.
      eval_summary_dir: The directory to write eval summaries. If None, it will

        are None, it will not write evaluation summarizes.
